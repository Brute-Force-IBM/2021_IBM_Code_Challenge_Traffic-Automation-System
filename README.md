PROBLEM STATEMENT
Traffic congestion problems consist of incremental delay, vehicle operating costs such as fuel consumption, pollution emissions and stress that result from interference among vehicles in the traffic stream.
Lack of an efficient Traffic management to replace the faulty and inefficient manual system leading to congestion and for critical emergency vehicles.
The congestion of urban traffic has become one of the critical issue with increasing population and automobiles in cities. Traffic jams not only cause extra delay and stress for the drivers, but also increase fuel consumption, add transportation costs, and increase air pollution.
